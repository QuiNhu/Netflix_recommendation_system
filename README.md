## NetFlix Recommendation System 

### About The Project
- Introduction: The system recommends movies from Netflix's data set based on Customer ID or Movie Title
- Methods: Collaborative Filtering and Pearson's Correlation method.
- How it works:
    - User selects user_id (integer) or Movie_Title
    - The system recommends 12-21 related movies based on user requests including:
        - *Poster*
        - *Movie Title*
        - *Year*
        - *Estimate Score* (evaluation score similar to user requirements, scale 0-1)
